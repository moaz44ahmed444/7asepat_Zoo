                <td class="paragraph">The king cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world. Special muscles and ribs in its neck spread out to form a "hood" when the cobra feels threatened. This makes the snake look bigger than it really is and may help scare predators away. King cobras make a deep, loud hiss, a warning signal that can be heard from a distance. The message is: "I am big, bad, and will bite you if you come any closer!" Most cobras are known to protect their eggs after laying them, but the female king cobra does even more. She uses her body and head to move leaves around to build a nest. After she lays her eggs, she covers them with more leaves and stays on top of the nest until the eggs hatch. Look for our king cobras, as well as other cobra species, in the Zoo’s popular Reptile House.</td>
                <td class="paragraph">Mang Mountain pit vipers are strikingly beautiful snakes with green scales to help them blend into their bamboo habitat. Native to China, their green and brown coloring is perfect camouflage for moving around a forest floor, and if the snakes stay still, they seem to vanish! See if YOU can find them. The winters in this viper’s habitat have many days of freezing temperatures. As colder days approach, Mang Mountain pit vipers crawl into caves and under rock ledges. Scientists have found that the snakes that go the deepest have the best chance of surviving until spring. Although their bite can deliver a deadly dose of venom, these snakes are shy most of the time. But a female guards her nest of eggs carefully and bites any creature that tries to steal them!  </td>
